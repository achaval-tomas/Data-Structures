# Data Structures
This is an interactive library to test, use and visualize many different data structures in C.

## Try them out
 Use ```` make run ```` to start an interactive menu and play around with different data structures. When done, use ```` make clean ````.

## Graphs and [Graphium](https://github.com/tomimara52/graphium)
**You will find an option to _'Export to Graphium'_ in the graph's menu. To use it properly, you must:**
- Check out [Graphium](https://github.com/tomimara52/graphium) and read how it works.
- Clone Graphium into the same directory where you cloned Data-Structures. Both dirs should be at the same level.
- Crete a graph, and select 'Export to Graphium'. If successful, a file will be created and saved into graphium.
- You can now **exit Data-Structures and open graphium** _**or**_ simply **open graphium in a new console**.
- Run Graphium (````cabal run````) and choose to load a graph from a file.
- Input Filename: ````importedGraph````.
- A window with your graph will pop up. You can now play around moving the vertices.
